# FKA &ndash; Framework for Kicking Ass #

## The Story ##

*Coming soon...*

## Status ##

This is currently work in process, I am still working on cleaning up the content for the
[College Edition][1], and adding a few more components (Quick Reference and Worksheet).
In addition, I need to figure out a better way to manage the content source and formatting
(see [Implementation Notes][2]).

Current editions:

* [college-edition][1]

## Implementation Notes ##

The source code for all of the material is currently in `.md` files, which I am then
compiling to HTML and post-processing using a Python script.  Pretty ugly stuff.  Will
work on a better framework for managing and publishing, since I would like to support the
ability to easily create and track other "editions" and forks.

## Future ##

I can imagine future editions to include:

* college-insider-edition
* med-school-edition
* professional-edition
* workout-edition
* etc.
