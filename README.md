# FKA &ndash; Framework for Kicking Ass #

## The Story ##

*Coming soon...*

## Status ##

This is currently work in process, I am still working on cleaning up the content for
the College Edition.  In addition, need to work on a better way to manage the source
copy and formatting (see [Implementation Notes](#implementation-notes)).

## Implementation Notes ##

The source code for tha material is currently in `.md` files, which I am then compiling
to HTML and post-processing using a Python script.  Pretty ugly stuff.  Will work on a
better framework for managing and publishing, since I would like to support the ability
to easily create and track other "editions" and forks.

## Future ##

I can imagine future "editions" to include:

* college-insider-edition
* med-school-edition
* professional-edition
* workout-edition
* etc.
