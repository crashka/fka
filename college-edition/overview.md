# Framework for Kicking Ass &ndash; Overview #

(College Edition, v0.7)

<header>Back to [FKA Index][17]</header>

## Preface ##

For any given task or assignment, the [Commitments and Responsibilities][1] you take on are critical to
determining the level of [Qualification and Accomplishment][2] you will attain. In particular, [Engagement][3],
[Completion][4], [Achievement][5], and [Learning][6] are all specific efforts and strong indicators of whether
you will [fail][7], [just get by][8], [really do well][9], or [seriously kick ass][10].

The following framework can be used as a tool for performing at your highest level in the course of your college
career.  This approach applies to individual homeworks and projects, to entire classes, or the overall course of
study in your major or minor field.

The **Framework for Kicking Ass** consists of the following:

* [Overview][11] &ndash; this document
* [User's Guide][12] &ndash; a How-To for applying the framework (including a Troubleshooting section)
* [Scorecard][14] &ndash; a way to project or measure your level of Qualification and Accomplishment
* [Quick Reference][15] &ndash; a one-page summary of the first three documents
* [Worksheet][16] &ndash; an aid for following through on the process described in the User's Guide

## Commitments and Responsibilities ##

These four components represent separate aspects of endeavoring to excel in your academics.  Even though they
can be described individually, they are intertwined in practice&mdash;they influence and support each other.

### Engagement ###

#### What it means ####

* Looking forward to immersing yourself in the work
* Getting tasks started, and making early progress toward completing them
* Always keeping things moving forward; maintaining momentum once started
* Thinking about the material and its implications; absorbing things, rather than just getting past them

#### Why do it? ####

* An early effort can propel you substantially toward an early completion (which is always better)
* Completion is both difficult and painful when disengaged, so you must make an effort to break the inertia if it starts to sets in
* Attention to the subject matter deepens your understanding, which always leads to stronger Achievement and Learning

#### Consequences ####

* Helpful for **Completion**
* Important for **Achievement**
* Essential for **Learning**

### Completion ###

#### What it means ####

* There are no magic shortcuts or allowances, you really have to do all of the work
* You must manage obstables and difficulties as they arise; excuses don't matter, you still have to do all of the work
* Finishing early always gives you an advantage; it allows you to move onto to other things (including free time), or to refactor your work
for even higher Achievement

#### Why do it? ####

* If you don't complete the work, there is no measure of Achievement, and no passing Qualification
* Partial credit counts for very little (if anything); the work is undone and earns you no meaningful recognition

#### Consequences ####

* Mandatory for **Achievement**
* Mandatory for **Qualificatiion**

### Achievement ###

#### What it means ####

* This is an objective measure of how well you have completed the work
* High Achievement gives you both a valid credential and a solid foundation for continuing on the path to your longer-term goals and aspirations

#### Why do it? ####

* Accomplishing a task below the level of your true capability is a missed opportunity and a setback for any ambitious targets you may have set for yourself

#### Consequences ####

* Determines level of **Qualification and Accomplishment**
    * Note: this is the difference between [Getting By][8] and [Doing Well][9]
* Reflection of **Engagement** and **Learning**

### Learning ###

#### What it means ####

* Truly digesting and retaining the principles, content, and skills, even beyond the end of an assignment
* Exploration of a subject area, both in breadth (scope) and depth (detail), beyond what is required for the task at hand (closely tied to Engagement)

#### Why do it? ####

* To easily and naturally apply your understanding and retention to problems in subsequent assignments, projects, or classes
* To build a solid foundation for continued Learning on a topic, especially if central to your chosen field of study or career goals

#### Consequences ####

* Not possible without **Engagement**
* Determines level of **Qualification and Accomplishment**
    * Note: this is the difference between [Doing Well][9] and [Kicking Ass!][10]

## Qualification and Accomplishment ##

The level of Qualification and Accomplishment for a task or assignment can be determined using the [Scorecard][14] for this framework, and
reflects the effort put into the Responsibilities and Commitments described above, as well as the performance and effectiveness exhibited
within each of the specific aspects/areas.

### No/Low Qualification &ndash; Failing to Complete ###

#### This is a poor outcome ####

* You did not complete your work to a satifactory level, and have thus failed to earn credit for the class or assignment
* You must retake the class, or redo the task or project, in order to move on to the next step in the journey

#### What you have to do ####

* See the [Troubleshooting][13] section of the User's Guide to help you get the requisite work completed, and achieve at a level you are capable of

### Basic Qualification &ndash; Getting By ###

#### This is a decent outcome ####

* You can be satisfied with your work
* You are qualified to go to the next level

#### *But*, you must think about the following ####

* You did not achieve to the level of your capability
* Your opportunities are more limited than if you had engaged better, and the work will be harder
* You need to put in more effort to ensure that your progress is not decelerating

### Strong Qualification &ndash; Doing Well ###

#### This is a very good outcome ####

* You should be proud of your work
* You are more than qualified to go to the next level

#### *But*, you should continue to aspire ####

* If this is a topic that is core to your desired long-term direction, you may want to attain an even higher level of Achievement or
develop a stronger legacy of Learning in the next leg of your journey
* In particular, think about what it would take in the Engagement process to help you get to a level of Exceptional Qualification

### Exceptional Qualification &ndash; Kicking Ass! ###

#### This is an outstanding outcome—you are on fire!!! ####

* You should be extremely proud of your work
* You are deeply engaged in something you believe in, and are damned good at it
* You have demonstrated excellence in both Achievement and Learning

#### *But*, always remember the following ####

* Exceptionality is an ongoing commitment and effort—there is no coasting
* You must continue to Engage, Complete, Achieve, and Learn in your work
* If you continue engaging strongly and driving with passion, ***there are no limits to where you can go!***
