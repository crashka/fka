# Framework for Kicking Ass &ndash; Overview #

(College Edition, v0.7)

## Preface ##

The [Commitments and Responsibilities][1] you take on for any given task or assignment are critical to
determining the level of [Qualification and Accomplishment][2] you will attain. In particular, [Engagement][3],
[Completion][4], [Achievement][5], and [Learning][6] are all specific efforts and indicators that strongly
affect whether you will fail, just get by, do well, or really kick ass.

In the context of schooling and education, the following framework can be used as a tool for performing at your
highest level—this applies to individual homeworks and projects, or to entire classes or courses of study.

The Framework for Kicking Ass consists of this Overview, a [User's Guide][11], and a [Scorecard][13].

## Commitments and Responsibilities ##

### Engagement ###

#### What it means ####

* Looking forward to immersing yourself in the work
* Getting tasks started, and making early progress toward completing them
* Always keeping things moving forward, maintaining momentum once started
* Spending time with the material, thinking about it and absorbing it, rather than just getting past it

#### Why do it? ####

* An early effort can get you 50% or more of the way to completion quickly
* There is a strong correlation between Engagement and both the ease of Completion and level of Achievement

#### Consequences ####

* Helpful for **Completion**
* Important for **Achievement**
* Essential for **Learning**

### Completion ###

#### What it means ####

* There are no magic shortcuts or allowances, you really have to do all of the work
* You have to manage obstables and difficulties; excuses don't matter, you still have to do all of the work
* Finishing earlier is always better than finishing later (same as with starting the work)
* Completion is much harder without Engagement, so you have to make the effort to break the inertia if it sets in

#### Why do it? ####

* There is no measure of Achievement, or a passing Qualification, without Completion
* Partial credit counts for very little (if anything); you get no meaningful recognition if you don't complete the work

#### Consequences ####

* Mandatory for **Achievement**
* Mandatory for **Qualificatiion**

### Achievement ###

#### What it means ####

* This is an objective measure of how well you have completed the work
* Higher Achievement gives you both a credential and a solid foundation for continuing on the path to your longer-term goals and objectives

#### Why do it? ####

* Accomplishing a task below the level of your true capability is a missed opportunity and a setback for fulfilling your aspirations

#### Consequences ####

* Determines level of **Qualification and Accomplishment**
    * This is the difference between [Getting By][8] and [Doing Well][9]
* Reflection of **Engagement** and **Learning**

### Learning ###

#### What it means ####

* Truly digesting and retaining the principles, content, and skills beyond the end of an assignment
* Exploration of a subject area, both in breadth (scope) and depth (detail), beyond what is required for the task at hand (this is closely tied to Engagement)

#### Why do it? ####

* To be able to easily apply your understanding and retention to problems in following assignments or semesters
* To build on the experience for continued Learning on the topic, especially if central to your chosen field of study or career goals

#### Consequences ####

* Not possible without **Engagement**
* Determines level of **Qualification and Accomplishment**
    * This is the difference between [Doing Well][9] and [Kicking Ass!][10]

## Qualification and Accomplishment ##

### No/Low Qualification &ndash; Failing to Complete ###

#### This is a poor outcome ####

* You did not complete your work to a satifactory level, and have thus failed to earn credit for the class or assignment
* You must retake the class, or redo the task or project, in order to move on to the next step in the journey

#### What you have to do ####

* See the [Troubleshooting][12] section of the User's Guide to help you get the requisite work completed, and achieve at a level you are capable of

### Basic Qualification &ndash; Getting By ###

#### This is a decent outcome ####

* You can be satisfied with your work
* You are qualified to go to the next level

#### *But*, you must think about the following ####

* You did not achieve to the level of your capability
* Your opportunities are more limited than if you had engaged better, and the work will be harder
* You need to put in more effort to ensure that your progress is not decelerating

### Strong Qualification &ndash; Doing Well ###

#### This is a very good outcome ####

* You should be proud of your work
* You are more than qualified to go to the next level

#### *But*, you should continue to aspire ####

* If this is a topic that is core to your desired long-term direction, you may want to attain an even higher level of Achievement or develop a stronger legacy of Learning in the next leg of your journey
* In particular, think about what it would take in the Engagement process to help you get to a level of Exceptional Qualification

### Exceptional Qualification &ndash; Kicking Ass! ###

#### This is an outstanding outcome—you are on fire!!! ####

* You should be extremely proud of your work
* You are deeply engaged in something you believe in, and are damned good at it
* You have demonstrated excellence in both Achievement and Learning

#### *But*, always remember the following ####

* Exceptionality is an ongoing commitment and effort—there is no coasting
* You must continue to Engage, Complete, Achieve, and Learn in your work
* If you continue engaging strongly and driving with passion, ***there are no limits to where you can go!***
