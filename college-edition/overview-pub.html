<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>For any given task or assignment, the <a href="#commitments-and-responsibilities">Commitments and Responsibilities</a> you take on are critical to determining the level of <a href="#qualification-and-accomplishment">Qualification and Accomplishment</a> you will attain. In particular, <a href="#engagement">Engagement</a>, <a href="#completion">Completion</a>, <a href="#achievement">Achievement</a>, and <a href="#learning">Learning</a> are all specific efforts and strong indicators of whether you will <a href="#nolow-qualification-failing-to-complete">fail</a>, <a href="#basic-qualification-getting-by">just get by</a>, <a href="#strong-qualification-doing-well">really do well</a>, or <a href="#exceptional-qualification-kicking-ass">seriously kick ass</a>.</p>
<p>The following framework can be used as a tool for performing at your highest level in the course of your college career. This approach applies to individual homeworks and projects, to entire classes, or the overall course of study in your major or minor field.</p>
<p>The <strong>Framework for Kicking Ass</strong> consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="overview-pub.html">Overview</a> – this document</li>
<li><a href="users-guide-pub.html">User's Guide</a> – a How-To for applying the framework (including a Troubleshooting section)</li>
<li><a href="scorecard-pub.html">Scorecard</a> – a way to project or measure your level of Qualification and Accomplishment</li>
<li><a href="quick-ref-pub.html">Quick Reference</a> – a one-page summary of the first three documents</li>
<li><a href="worksheet-pub.html">Worksheet</a> – an aid for following through on the process described in the User's Guide</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commitments-and-responsibilities">Commitments and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>These four components represent separate aspects of endeavoring to excel in your academics. Even though they can be described individually, they are intertwined in practice—they influence and support each other.</p>
<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<table border="1"><col width="20%"/><tr><td><p id="what-it-means">What it means</p></td><td>
<ul>
<li>Looking forward to immersing yourself in the work</li>
<li>Getting tasks started, and making early progress toward completing them</li>
<li>Always keeping things moving forward; maintaining momentum once started</li>
<li>Thinking about the material and its implications; absorbing things, rather than just getting past them</li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><p id="why-do-it">Why do it?</p></td><td>
<ul>
<li>An early effort can propel you substantially toward an early completion (which is always better)</li>
<li>Completion is both difficult and painful when disengaged, so you must make an effort to break the inertia if it starts to sets in</li>

<li>You must manage obstables and difficulties as they arise; excuses don't matter, you still have to do all of the work</li>
