<h1 id="framework-for-kicking-ass-overview">Framework for Kicking Ass – Overview</h1>
<p>(College Edition, v0.7)</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>The <a href="#commitments-and-responsibilities">Commitments and Responsibilities</a> you take on for any given task or assignment are critical to determining the level of <a href="#qualification-and-accomplishment">Qualification and Accomplishment</a> you will attain. In particular, <a href="#engagement">Engagement</a>, <a href="#completion">Completion</a>, <a href="#achievement">Achievement</a>, and <a href="#learning">Learning</a> are all specific efforts and indicators that strongly affect whether you will fail, just get by, do well, or really kick ass.</p>
<p>In the context of schooling and education, the following framework can be used as a tool for performing at your highest level—this applies to individual homeworks and projects, or to entire classes or courses of study.</p>
<p>The Framework for Kicking Ass consists of this Overview, a <a href="users-guide-pub.html">User's Guide</a>, and a <a href="scorecard-pub.html">Scorecard</a>.</p>
