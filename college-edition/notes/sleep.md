# Sleep #

## Managing sleep is necessary as a commitment to your objectives when it comes to credits and grades ##

Decent sleep is important for:

* Getting to class on time (or at all)
* Being attentive and alert in class
* Doing homework at normal hours (e.g. when everyone else is doing it)
* Overall mental and physical health (your brain works better)
    * Normal eating schedule and reasonably balanced diet (not possible at 3am)
    * Normal exercise routine (not possible without sufficient/regular sleep)

## Not having (or working toward) a regular and adequate sleep schedule is an abdication of Engagement with your academic tasks and intentions ##

It negatively affects all of the following:

* Class attendance
* Class participation
* Getting tutoring or assistance
* Effort and quality in homework assignments
* Ability to study and perform for tests

## If you have a problem with sleep, you need to fix it, otherwise you will not complete your work or achieve close to the level you are capable of ##

You will not be able to blame sleep problems for your inability to accomplish your objectives, especially if you don't make the concerted effort to acknowledge and remedy them
