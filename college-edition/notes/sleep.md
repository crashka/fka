# FKA Notes &ndash; Sleep #

## Managing sleep is necessary as a commitment to your objectives when it comes to credits and grades ##

Decent sleep is important for:

* Getting to class on time (or at all)
* Being attentive and alert in class
* Doing homework at normal hours (e.g. when everyone else is doing it)
* Overall mental and physical health (your brain works better)
    * Normal eating schedule and reasonably balanced diet (not possible at 3am)
    * Normal exercise routine (not possible without sufficient/regular sleep)

## Not having (or working toward) a regular and adequate sleep schedule is an abdication of Engagement with your academic tasks and intentions ##

It negatively affects all of the following:

* Class attendance
* Class participation
* Getting tutoring or assistance
* Effort and quality in homework assignments
* Ability to study and perform for tests

## If you have a problem with sleep, you need to fix it, otherwise you will not complete your work or achieve close to the level you are capable of ##

Possible sources of sleep problems, and how to address them:

* **Health issues**
    * See a doctor to discuss symptoms and diagnose the root cause (which could include the next item, stress)
    * Commit to following through on any advice or treatment plan you are given
* **Stress**
    * Identify and remove (or resolve) the underlying source of your stress
    * If you are unable to reduce the stress to a manageable level (so that you have a healthy sleep schedule), you may have to adjust
      your workload or ambitions to fit your current work abilities
* **Academic workload**
    * If your work habits and priorities are good, but the sheer amount of work prevents you from adopting a healthy sleep schedule, then
      you need to cut back on the number (or difficulty) of classes you are taking
    * Or you may need to pull back on other activities and interests that take up your time, even if they are important to your long-term
      goals or needs; you must make a reasonable trade-off between academics and extra-curriculars
* **Non-academic distractions or time-sinks**
    * You have to find a way to reprioritize your time and attention; you must elevate the importance of sleep and participation in school
    * If you are unable to change your priorities and sleep habits on your own, you need to seek counseling or guidance for following
      through on commitment to your academic success

***You will not be able to blame sleep problems for your inability to accomplish your objectives, especially if you don't make a concerted
effort to acknowledge them and remedy them***
