# FKA Notes &ndash; Sleep #

## Managing sleep is necessary as a commitment to your objectives when it comes to credits and grades ##

Decent sleep is important for:

* Getting to class on time (or at all)
* Being attentive and alert in class
* Doing homework at normal hours (e.g. when everyone else is doing it)
* Overall mental and physical health (your brain works better)
    * Normal eating schedule and reasonably balanced diet (not possible at 3am)
    * Normal exercise routine (not possible without sufficient/regular sleep)

## Not having (or working toward) a regular and adequate sleep schedule is an abdication of Engagement with your academic tasks and intentions ##

It negatively affects all of the following:

* Class attendance
* Class participation
* Getting tutoring or assistance
* Effort and quality in homework assignments
* Ability to study and perform for tests

## If you have a problem with sleep, you need to fix it, otherwise you will not complete your work or achieve close to the level you are capable of ##

Posssible sources of sleep problems, and how to address them:

* **Health issues**
    * See a doctor to discuss symptoms and diagnose the root cause (which could include the next item, stress)
    * Commit to following through on any advice or treatment plan you are given
* **Stress**
    * Identify and remove (or resolve) the underlying source of your stress
    * If you are unable to reduce the stress to a manageable level, you may have to adjust your workload or ambitions to fit your current
      work abilities
* **Non-academic distractions or time-sinks**
    * You have to find a way to reprioritize your time and attention; you must elevate the importance of sleep and participation in school
    * If you are unable to change your priorities and sleep habits on your own, you need to seek counseling or guidance for committing to
      your academic success

***You will not be able to blame sleep problems for your inability to accomplish your objectives, especially if you don't make a concerted
effort to acknowledge them and remedy them***
