<h3 id="problems-with-engagement">Problems with Engagement</h3>
<table border="1"><col width="25%"/><tr><td><h4 id="difficulty-engaging-in-a-required-task">Difficulty engaging in a required task</h4></td><td>
<p>If this in on your critical path to success (e.g. graduation requirement for your major, or prerequisite for an intended area of study), you absolutely must complete this assignment. Furthermore, it is important that you not just get by, but achieve at a high level, so you really have to find a way to get engaged.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no choice: you have to recommit yourself to the task (see <a href="#commitment">Commitment</a>, above). This means you need to bring on new tools or new resources.
<ul>
<li>If you are still having trouble engaging with one set of tools or resources, you have to keep trying others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If this difficulty of engaging becomes a recurring pattern for required tasks, you may need to adjust or re-evaluate your overall chosen path.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><h4 id="difficulty-engaging-in-an-optional-or-elective-task">Difficulty engaging in an optional or elective task</h4></td><td>
<p>While it may not be as critical for you to accomplish a top result for this task, you will likely underperform on it. In addition, the effort you do put into it may be better spent on something more meaningful to you and your real objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>As above, you should try and find additional tools or resources to help you get engaged and perform to the level of your abilities, otherwise you should replace the task with a suitable alternative (or even drop it) as early as possible in the process.</li>
<li>If this difficulty of engaging becomes a pattern for other tasks, you should re-examine your process for choosing electives, and learn how to take on tasks that are interesting and constructive for you.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><h4 id="recognizing-different-types-of-anti-engagement">Recognizing different types of Anti-Engagement</h4></td><td>
<p>Anti-Engagement leads to failure, so you must learn to recognize it, and make sure not to leave any tasks in this state. Touble engaging in a task usually begins with <strong>Avoidance</strong> of the task.</p>
<ul>
<li>You avoid getting started on it; you avoid talking about it; you avoid thinking about it. It is basically hanging over your head.</li>
<li>This is an uncomfortable situation, but at least you haven't forgotten about the task. You actually have a chance to get engaged on the task if you recommit to it and execute on it, as described above.</li>
<li>But if you just can't get engaged and there is no chance of completing it successfully, you must try and get it off of your plate.
<ul>
<li>Note, if this happens too many times, then you are in the realm of <a href="#problems-with-completion">Problems with Completion</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, the Avoidance becomes troublesome—every reminder of the task becomes painful—so you shift into <strong>Complete Neglect</strong> of the task.</p>
<ul>
<li>You put it out of your mind and pretend that it doesn't exist, and soon you may truly forget that you are shirking a real-world responsibility.
<ul>
<li>This is a dangerous mode to get into—you must bring the task back into your consciousness and hold yourself accountable to addressing it, one way or another.</li>
<li>You must understand that it will never truly go away by itself—as much as you'd like it to—and if you deal with it too late (or not at all), the consequence will be much worse for you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In readdressing the task, you have pulled it back to the level of Avoidance, and must now turn it into engagement, or scrap it. If you do not act now, it will most likely fall back into Complete Neglect, and ultimately failure.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table><h3 id="problems-with-completion">Problems with Completion</h3>
<table border="1"><col width="25%"/><tr><td><h4 id="something-external-is-hindering-your-ability-to-complete-a-task">Something external is hindering your ability to complete a task</h4></td><td>
<p>Things come up that interfere with your ability to get the work done. They may impact the time and focus you can bring to it (in the case of personal or health issues), or may impact your ability to learn or study effectively (in the case of problems with teachers or resources or tools that you use).</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to identify and characterize the hindrance.</li>
<li>You need to remove it or learn to manage it, one way or another.</li>
<li>And then you need to get re-engaged in the task, including catching up or making up for lost work, if needed.</li>
<li>This is important: you still have to complete the work, even if it is late!
<ul>
<li>You cannot take credit for it, and you cannot move onto the next step, unless and until it is done.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><h4 id="something-internal-is-hindering-your-ability-to-complete-a-task">Something internal is hindering your ability to complete a task</h4></td><td>
<p>Sometimes there are no identifiable external factors, but rather something in your head or in your work habits that is affecting your ability to get your work done. You may need to manage this situation differently than above.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try and pinpoint the underlying problem and find ways of addressing it. As with external factors, once the issue is resolved or managable, you must still re-engage in, and complete, the work in order to get credit and move on.</li>
<li>If you are unable to identify and resolve the internal hindrance, chances are good that it is really an overall Engagement problem, and should be addressed as such.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><h4 id="your-overall-workload-is-preventing-you-from-completing-required-tasks">Your overall workload is preventing you from completing required tasks</h4></td><td>
<ul>
<li>You may be too ambitious, and should make adjustments to the work you are taking on. You must be able to complete your assignments in order to get credit for them and truly learn the subject matter.
<ul>
<li>Note that an overloaded schedule also interferes with proper engagement with all of your assignments, and your performance will suffer from it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If this becomes a common recurrence, you also have to re-evaluate your overall approach (i.e. pacing, milestones, etc.) for your chosen course of study.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table><h3 id="problems-with-achievement-and-learning">Problems with Achievement (and Learning)</h3>
<p><strong>You must pay attention to this section if you are getting grades below the level of your capability.</strong> You may get screwed on the grading of an assignment or a class here and there, but in all other cases, you must take ownership of your measured Achievement and work on getting it to the appropriate level.</p>
<p>Note that underperforming on Achievement generally also means that you didn't learn the material properly or thoroughly, since they are both tied to either your level of Engagement, or your mastery (or struggles) with the materials. Thus, working on problems with Achievement can also benefit your overall learning, and hence your ability to kick ass!</p>
<table border="1"><col width="25%"/><tr><td><h4 id="a-task-seems-really-easy-you-take-it-for-granted-and-you-get-a-mediocre-grade">A task seems really easy, you take it for granted, and you get a mediocre grade</h4></td><td>
<p>There is no such thing as a task that is too easy, assuming your curriculum is well-defined and properly chosen. Even if you know it will be relatively effortless for you to complete, you cannot just pretend that the work is as good as done.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must always put in a proper effort even for easy tasks. If you don't, you will lose the opportunity to demonstrate real proficiency and build your overall credential.
<ul>
<li>In addition, a mediocre grade on an easy assignment is often viewed as a failure, of either ability or effort. Either case is bad for you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes a class or assignment seems like it will be simple to complete and do well on, but the complexity or amount of work may not be initially apparent. Thus, you must still engage in the work.
<ul>
<li>If it turns out that the assignment was harder than you thought, you will find out sooner and give yourself the chance to put in the effort required to do it properly.</li>
<li>If the assignment really does requie little effort from you, then it should be no real imposition on you to get the jump on it, get it done early, and free yourself up for other tasks.
<ul>
<li>And if you also put in more than the minimum effort, you can deliver a solution that stands out, as well as deepens your understanding of the subject.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><h4 id="a-task-is-really-harder-than-it-seems-and-you-get-a-low-grade-even-though-you-put-in-a-proper-effort">A task is really harder than it seems, and you get a low grade even though you put in a proper effort</h4></td><td>
<p>This can happen because certain topics or types of assignments are inherently difficult for you, or you may have overreached in choosing the rate of advancement, or the specific track, within your curriculum or major.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be able to get a handle on the subject and the work requirements by seeking out additional resources (e.g. tutor or materials), or by dedicating more effort to the course.
<ul>
<li>However, in both cases, you may now run the danger of being <a href="#your-overall-workload-is-preventing-you-from-completing-required-tasks">overloaded</a>. You should be careful not to sacrifice your standing and potential to achieve in your other assignments and areas of study.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In most cases, you should try and identify the specific challenge you faced in the class or assignment, and make adjustments to your class selection or preparation going forward.
<ul>
<li>Maintaining your ability to fully understand, complete, and do well on tasks is much more important than the pace of earning credits. You should always trade off velocity in order to attain mastery.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><h4 id="you-arent-fully-engaged-in-an-assignment-you-scramble-to-get-it-done-and-you-underperform">You aren't fully engaged in an assignment, you scramble to get it done, and you underperform</h4></td><td>
<p>You may be able to complete an assignment without ever engaging, but if you are just getting by as a result of that, you are adding risk to your longer term goals and objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must recognize that underachievement, even in minor topics, accrues as negative credential, so you must work at Engaging, if that is the problem.
<ul>
<li>As <a href="#problems-with-engagement">stated above</a>, you may need to treat required tasks and elective tasks differently. And you must endeavor not to let Avoidance (which makes tasks harder than they really are) slip into Complete Neglect (assured failure).</li>
