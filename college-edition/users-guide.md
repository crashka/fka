# Framework for Kicking Ass &ndash; User's Guide #

(College Edition, v0.7)

## Process &ndash; Start to Finish ##

### Intention ###

You are given a task or assignment to do, and you have the **Intention** to do well.

1. You should set your achievement goals based on the following:
    * How important this work or subject area is to your long-term direction and aspirations
    * Your level of aptitude and capability in the subject area or type of assignment
2. You should also try and identify potential hazards you may have in undertaking the work, either
due to difficulties with prerequisites in the area, or possible additional challenges, such as a
heavy overall workload or current personal issues.

### Commitment ###

You must explicitly turn that Intention into a **Commitment** in order to give yourself the best chance
to meet your achievement goals.

1. If you have failed to attain the level of Qualification and Accomplishment you wanted for one or more recent
tasks (or classes), you must acknowledge that you will likely end up with the same outcome if you don't make the
effort to bring a more structured approach to your work.
2. If you *did* utilize the Framework&mdash;or some other tool or approach&mdash;and still came up short, then
you must seek out additional resources and methods, and/or apply them in a different way.
3. In either case, you absolutely must change *something* up, or you will suffer the same fate as before.
4. Even if you have succeed in the past, do not be complacent in the current assignment.
    * You must still make an explicit commitment to your new objectives by continuing the utilize the Framework
    or other tools.

### Execution ###

Now you must **Execute** on that Commitment by actively utilizing the Framework, in conjuction with any other
tools/approaches you are able to bring to the problem.

1. Use the Scorecard as a guide for staying on track during the course of the assignment, as well as for evidence
of your level of Commitment afterward.
2. If you were able to perform at&mdash;or above&mdash;the level of your original Intention:
    * Congratulations.  You should have confidence that you are able to adopt and utilize the tools that you
    need to achieve.
    * You should continue your positive work habits, and even look for opportunities for improving, especially
    in areas you are most passionate about, or that are most important to your future.
3. If you did not perform at a level consistent with your original Intention:
    * You must work harder at your Commitment to success in your undertakings.
        * Revisit all of the Commitments and Responsibilities outlined in the Overview section of the Framework.
        * Remember that these obligations are to yourself&mdash;they are guidelines for achieving your own goals and expectations.
    * If you really believe that you have fully Committed and Executed to the limits of your capability and continue
    to underperform, then you may be overreaching or improperly oriented.
        * You may need to reset your achievement goals to be more realistic.
        * You may also want to re-examine the path you are on, and ask yourself if your difficulties are actually
        indicators that the direction you are taking may need adjustment or broader rethinking.

### Bottom Line ###

You must accept following precepts as truisms, and hold yourself to abide by them, otherwise you will fail.

1. You **do not** get credit for good **Intention**
    * This is necessary, but not sufficient.
2. You **do not** get credit for strong **Commitment**
    * This is also necessary, but not sufficient.
3. You **only** get credit for successful **Execution**
    * You must follow through on your Intention and your Commitment in order to complete the task,
    earn the credential, and qualify yourself to move on.
    * You must think of this follow through as non-negociable, and trust that it will get
    easier&mdash;almost automatic&mdash;over time if you learn to use the proper tools.

## Using the Scorecard ##

### Mid-Task/-Project Evaluation and Adjustment ###

You will not be able to completely fill out all sections of the Scorecard, but do as much as you can to
give yourself an objective assessment of what outcome you are currentlty headed for, and where you will
need to focus to get the outcome you desire.

1. Focus on the Engagement section and the "In-Process Assessment" criteria of the Completion section.
    * Identify risks in these areas and commit to catching up, or staying on top of them, since these are
    consequential to the Achievement and Learning pieces.
2. Based on your target Qualification Level, determine what you will need to accomplish in terms of intermediary
and finals grades for the project or class, as well as the degree of subject matter immersion and absorption.
    * Ask yourself honestly whether you are on track to hit those marks.  If it is not clear, then you must
    commit to putting in the time and effort to get there.

### Completed Task/Project Analysis ###

The Scorecard for completed assignments or classes can be used to understand exactly what you did right and
wrong in getting to the outcome you obtained.  Lessons from this assessment should be digested and applied to
the next project or semester.

1. Fill out your scores honestly and objectively for Engagement, Completion, Achievement, and Learning.
2. Using the guidelines in the Scorecard, determine the Qualification Level you have attained.
    * By design, this level is primarily ordained by your letter grade in the assignment or class.
    * Resist the temptation to bump up your score due to "pluses" (e.g. B+), or construed degree of difficulty
    of the task.
        * This only interferes with your ability to continue improving and genuinely reaching your long-term objectives.
3. If this computed level doesn't match your personal assessment of your accomplishment, then you need to look closely at
the factors contributing to the individual component scores.
    * Identify any aspects of the work process that you did not fully commit to that might have contributed to your shortcoming.
        * You must acknowledge and hold yourself accountable for the real effort exerted, and the efficacy of your work habits,
        or you will not be able to gain control over your academic fate.
    * If you are truly not able to reconcile the scores with the Qualification Level, you should consider reworking
    the scoring criteria in the Scorecard to make the process more accurate and reliable.

## Troubleshooting ##

### Problems with Engagement ###

#### Difficulty engaging in a required task ####

If this in on your critical path to success (e.g. graduation requirement for your major, or prerequisite for an
intended area of study), you absolutely must complete this assignment.  Furthermore, it is important that you
not just get by, but achieve at a high level, so you really have to find a way to get engaged.

* You have no choice: you have to recommit yourself to the task (see [Commitment][2], above).  This means you
need to bring on new tools or new resources.
    * If you are still having trouble engaging with one set of tools or resources, you have to keep trying others.
* If this difficulty of engaging becomes a recurring pattern for required tasks, you may need to adjust or re-evaluate
your overall chosen path.

#### Difficulty engaging in an optional or elective task ####

While it may not be as critical for you to accomplish a top result for this task, you will likely underperform on
it.  In addition, the effort you do put into it may be better spent on something more meaningful to you and your
real objectives.

* As above, you should try and find additional tools or resources to help you get engaged and perform to the level
of your abilities, otherwise you should replace the task with a suitable alternative (or even drop it) as early as
possible in the process.
* If this difficulty of engaging becomes a pattern for other tasks, you should re-examine your process for choosing
electives, and learn how to take on tasks that are interesting and constructive for you.

#### Recognizing different types of Anti-Engagement ####

Anti-Engagement leads to failure, so you must learn to recognize it, and make sure not to leave any tasks in this
state.  Touble engaging in a task usually begins with **Avoidance** of the task.

* You avoid getting started on it; you avoid talking about it; you avoid thinking about it.  It is basically
hanging over your head.
* This is an uncomfortable situation, but at least you haven't forgotten about the task.  You actually have a chance
to get engaged on the task if you recommit to it and execute on it, as described above.
* But if you just can't get engaged and there is no chance of completing it successfully, you must try and get it
off of your plate.
    * Note, if this happens too many times, then you are in the realm of [Problems with Completion][5].

Over time, the Avoidance becomes troublesome&mdash;every reminder of the task becomes painful&mdash;so you shift into
**Complete Neglect** of the task.

* You put it out of your mind and pretend that it doesn't exist, and soon you may truly forget that you are shirking
a real-world responsibility.
    * This is a dangerous mode to get into&mdash;you must bring the task back into your consciousness and hold yourself
    accountable to addressing it, one way or another.
    * You must understand that it will never truly go away by itself&mdash;as much as you'd like it to&mdash;and if you
    deal with it too late (or not at all), the consequence will be much worse for you.
* In readdressing the task, you have pulled it back to the level of Avoidance, and must now turn it into engagement,
or scrap it.  If you do not act now, it will most likely fall back into Complete Neglect, and ultimately failure.

### Problems with Completion ###

#### Something external is hindering your ability to complete a task ####

Things come up that interfere with your ability to get the work done.  They may impact the time and focus you can
bring to it (in the case of personal or health issues), or may impact your ability to learn or study effectively
(in the case of problems with teachers or resources or tools that you use).

* You need to identify and characterize the hindrance.
* You need to remove it or learn to manage it, one way or another.
* And then you need to get re-engaged in the task, including catching up or making up for lost work, if needed.
* This is important: you still have to complete the work, even if it is late!
    * You cannot take credit for it, and you cannot move onto the next step, unless and until it is done.

#### Something internal is hindering your ability to complete a task ####

Sometimes there are no identifiable external factors, but rather something in your head or in your work habits that
is affecting your ability to get your work done.  You may need to manage this situation differently than above.

* You can try and pinpoint the underlying problem and find ways of addressing it.  As with external factors, once the
issue is resolved or managable, you must still re-engage in, and complete, the work in order to get credit and move on.
* If you are unable to identify and resolve the internal hindrance, chances are good that it is really an overall
Engagement problem, and should be addressed as such.

#### Your overall workload is preventing you from completing required tasks ####

* You may be too ambitious, and should make adjustments to the work you are taking on.  You must be able to complete
your assignments in order to get credit for them and truly learn the subject matter.
    * Note that an overloaded schedule also interferes with proper engagement with all of your assignments, and
    your performance will suffer from it.
* If this becomes a common recurrence, you also have to re-evaluate your overall approach (i.e. pacing, milestones,
etc.) for your chosen course of study.

### Problems with Achievement (and Learning) ###

**You must pay attention to this section if you are getting grades below the level of your capability.**  You may get
screwed on the grading of an assignment or a class here and there, but in all other cases, you must take ownership
of your measured Achievement and work on getting it to the appropriate level.

Note that underperforming on Achievement generally also means that you didn't learn the material properly or thoroughly,
since they are both tied to either your level of Engagement, or your mastery (or struggles) with the materials.  Thus,
working on problems with Achievement can also benefit your overall learning, and hence your ability to kick ass!

#### A task seems really easy, you take it for granted, and you get a mediocre grade ####

There is no such thing as a task that is too easy, assuming your curriculum is well-defined and properly chosen.  Even if
you know it will be relatively effortless for you to complete, you cannot just pretend that the work is as good as done.

* You must always put in a proper effort even for easy tasks.  If you don't, you will lose the opportunity to demonstrate
real proficiency and build your overall credential.
    * In addition, a mediocre grade on an easy assignment is often viewed as a failure, of either ability or effort.  Either
    case is bad for you.
* Sometimes a class or assignment seems like it will be simple to complete and do well on, but the complexity or amount
of work may not be initially apparent.  Thus, you must still engage in the work.
    * If it turns out that the assignment was harder than you thought, you will find out sooner and give yourself the
    chance to put in the effort required to do it properly.
    * If the assignment really does requie little effort from you, then it should be no real imposition on you to get
    the jump on it, get it done early, and free yourself up for other tasks.
        * And if you also put in more than the minimum effort, you can deliver a solution that stands out, as well as
        deepens your understanding of the subject.

#### A task is really harder than it seems, and you get a low grade even though you put in a proper effort ####

This can happen because certain topics or types of assignments are inherently difficult for you, or you may have
overreached in choosing the rate of advancement, or the specific track, within your curriculum or major.

* You may be able to get a handle on the subject and the work requirements by seeking out additional resources
(e.g. tutor or materials), or by dedicating more effort to the course.
    * However, in both cases, you may now run the danger of being [overloaded][7].  You should be careful not to
    sacrifice your standing and potential to achieve in your other assignments and areas of study.
* In most cases, you should try and identify the specific challenge you faced in the class or assignment, and
make adjustments to your class selection or preparation going forward.
    * Maintaining your ability to fully understand, complete, and do well on tasks is much more important than
    the pace of earning credits.  You should always trade off velocity in order to attain mastery.

#### You aren't fully engaged in an assignment, you scramble to get it done, and you underperform ####

You may be able to complete an assignment without ever engaging, but if you are just getting by as a result of
that, you are adding risk to your longer term goals and objectives.

* You must recognize that underachievement, even in minor topics, accrues as negative credential, so you must work
at Engaging, if that is the problem.
    * As [stated above][4], you may need to treat required tasks and elective tasks differently.  And you must endeavor
    not to let Avoidance (which makes tasks harder than they really are) slip into Complete Neglect (assured failure).
