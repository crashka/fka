<h2 id="end-to-end-process">End-to-End Process</h2>
<h3 id="intention">Intention</h3>
<p>You are given a task or assignment to do, and you have the <strong>Intention</strong> to do well.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should set your achievement goals based on the following:
<ul>
<li>How important this work or subject area is to your long-term direction and aspirations</li>
<li>Your level of aptitude and capability in the subject area or type of assignment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should also try and identify potential hazards you may have in undertaking the work, either due to difficulties with prerequisites in the area, or possible additional challenges, such as a heavy overall workload or current personal issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commmitment">Commmitment</h3>
<p>You must explicitly turn that Intention into a <strong>Commitment</strong> in order to give yourself the best chance to meet your achievement goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have failed to attain the level of Qualification and Accomplishment you wanted for one or more recent tasks (or classes), you must acknowledge that you will likely end up with the same outcome if you don't make the effort to bring a more structured approach to your work.</li>
<li>If you <em>did</em> utilize the Framework—or some other tool or approach—and still came up short, then you must seek out additional resources and methods, and/or apply them in a different way.</li>
<li>In either case, you absolutely must change <em>something</em> up, or you will suffer the same fate as before.</li>
<li>Even if you have succeed in the past, do not be complacent in the current assignment.
<ul>
<li>You must still make an explicit commitment to your new objectives by continuing the utilize the Framework or other tools.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>Now you must <strong>Execute</strong> on that Commitment by actively utilizing the Framework, in conjuction with any other tools/approaches you are able to bring to the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Scorecard as a guide for staying on track during the course of the assignment, as well as for evidence of your level of Commitment afterward.</li>
<li>If you were able to perform at—or above—the level of your original Intention:
<ul>
<li>Congratulations. You should have confidence that you are able to adopt and utilize the tools that you need to achieve.</li>
<li>You should continue your positive work habits, and even look for opportunities for improving, especially in areas you are most passionate about, or that are most important to your future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you did not perform at a level consistent with your original Intention:
<ul>
<li>You must work harder at your Commitment to success in your undertakings.
<ul>
<li>Revisit all of the Commitments and Responsibilities outlined in the Overview section of the Framework.</li>
<li>Remember that these obligations are to yourself—they are guidelines for achieving your own goals and expectations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you really believe that you have fully Committed and Executed to the limits of your capability and continue to underperform, then you may be overreaching or improperly oriented.
<ul>
<li>You may need to reset your achievement goals to be more realistic.</li>
<li>You may also want to reexamine the path you are on, and ask yourself if your difficulties are actually indicators that the direction you are taking may need adjustment or broader rethinking.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h3>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>do not</strong> get credit for good <strong>Intention</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is necessary, but not sufficient</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You <strong>do not</strong> get credit for strong <strong>Commitment</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is also necessary, but not sufficient</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You <strong>only</strong> get credit for successful <strong>Execution</strong>
<ul>
<li>You must follow through on your Intention and your Commitment in order to accomplish and move on</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-the-scorecard">Using the Scorecard</h2>
<h3 id="mid-task-project-evaluation-and-adjustment">Mid-Task/-Project Evaluation and Adjustment</h3>
<p>You will not be able to completely fill out all sections of the Scorecard, but do as much as you can to give yourself an objective assessment of what outcome you are currentlty headed for, and where you will need to focus to get the outcome you desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the Engagement section and the &quot;In-Process Assessment&quot; criteria of the Completion section.
<ul>
<li>Identify risks in these areas and commit to catching up, or staying on top of them, since these are consequential to the Achievement and Learning pieces.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on your target Qualification Level, determine what you will need to accomplish in terms of intermediary and finals grades for the project or class, as well as the degree of subject matter immersion and absorption.
<ul>
<li>Ask yourself honestly whether you are on track to hit those marks. If it is not clear, then you must commit to putting in the time and effort to get there.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="completed-taskproject-analysis">Completed Task/Project Analysis</h3>
<p>The Scorecard for completed assignments or classes can be used to understand exactly what you did right and wrong in getting to the outcome you obtained. Lessons from this assessment should be digested and applied to the next project or semester.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill out your scores honestly and objectively for Engagement, Completion, Achievement, and Learning.</li>
<li>Using the guidelines in the Scorecard, determine the Qualification Level you have attained.
<ul>
<li>By design, this level is primarily ordained by your letter grade in the assignment or class.</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to bump up your score due to &quot;pluses&quot; (e.g. B+), or construed degree of difficulty of the task.
<ul>
<li>This only interferes with your ability to continue improving and genuinely reaching your long-term objectives.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If this computed level doesn't match your personal assessment of your accomplishment, then you need to look closely at the factors contributing to the individual component scores.
<ul>
<li>Identify any aspects of the work process that you did not fully commit to that might have contributed to your shortcoming.
<ul>
<li>You must acknowledge and hold yourself accountable for the real effort exerted, and the efficacy of your work habits, or you will not be able to gain control over your academic fate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are truly not able to reconcile the scores with the Qualification Level, you should consider reworking the scoring criteria in the Scorecard to make the process more accurate and reliable.</li>
</ul></li>
